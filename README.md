👋 Hi, I’m Shivam

B.Tech CSE @ DTU (2022–2026)
Full-stack developer with a strong DSA backbone. I build real products, not tutorial junk.

🧠 1000+ DSA problems solved

⚙️ MERN + Next.js + AI integrations

🚀 Performance-obsessed (FCP/LCP improvements, not vibes)

🧪 Currently exploring AI-powered web products
